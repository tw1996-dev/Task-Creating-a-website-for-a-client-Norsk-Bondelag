Project: Build a updated/new replica of the "Bondelaget" Website
Objective: Create the homepage focusing on layout, navigation, and basic interactive elements using HTML and CSS. 
Imagine the client has briefed you as follow (the criteria underneath).

Requirements:

Layout: Keep the homepage's structure, but only keep the following top menu items: "Bondelaget mener", "Kontakt", and "Bli medlem".
Your task is to replicate the basic layout on these pages using HTML but feel free to update the design to something more fresh 
and modern that you like better. The main color (Yellow) have to stay the same, but you can change the rest.
Rememeber: Keeping things simple and easy to read is usually a good idea, instead of creating an elaborate design.

Focus on creating the header, the main content area with different sections, and the footer first. 
On the subpages you can just keep the menu items, but you do NOT have to create each sub-page. Just the ones we mentioned on top.

Navigation Bar: Implement a navigation bar at the top of your page. It should be visually similar to the Bondelaget's nav-bar, including hover effects.

Styling with CSS: Use CSS to style your webpage to match the color scheme, fonts, and general style of Bondelaget's homepage.
Keep the yellow color but other than that you are free to play a bit with font, other colors and some layout.
If you feel you can make it more modern and better, feel free to experiment.

Images and Icons: Include placeholder images where the original site uses visual content. If the site uses icons (for social media links,
for example), you can substitute these with freely available icons or placeholders. For content - feel free to use a AI generated image,
or find images at https://www.pexels.com/

Interactivity: Implement basic interactivity such as hover effects on buttons and links using CSS.
If you're comfortable with JavaScript you are free to use this, but you will learn Javascript later so do not worry to much about it now.
